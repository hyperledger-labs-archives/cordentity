# Lab Name
Cordentity

# Short Description
The Cordentity app integrates [Hyperledger Indy](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-sdk) capabilities into the opensource [Corda platform](https://github.com/corda/corda).

While Corda is designed for developing decentralized applications to
manage complex inter-organizational workflows, Indy is the leading
open-source platform for self sovereign identity. This integration
enables the development of decentralized applications on R3's blockchain 
for business while utilizing the self-sovereign identity capabilities 
of Indy.

# Scope of Lab
Cordentity is a self-contained CorDapp that integrates Hyperledger
Indy, for decentralized identity, with the R3 Corda Platform. This
lab creates interoperability of two purpose-built ledger
technologies, each with a focus on privacy. Corda is designed to
enable private transact and Indy is a ledger built specifically for
self-sovereign identity. The integrated platforms reinforce each
other and allows building complicated scenarios.

It is often required to prove identity assertions without necessarily
wanting to reveal the underlying data. For example, an individual may 
need to prove that they are of a certain age without wanting to 
disclose their actual date of birth. Hyperledger Indy uses zero 
knowledge proofs to enable this functionality, allowing someone prove 
a statement is true while preserving confidentiality.
